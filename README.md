# blackmountainstesting.github.io

Blackmountain testing was formed after observing that QA as a craft had largely been forgotten in the rush to automate everything
We believe that individuals are your greatest asset
We believe that quality is context dependent
We believe that automated test execution has a place
We belive that teams develop software
We are individuals with a wide range of experiences in the quality domain
We are individuals who will work with you to affect a positive outcome
We are individuals that care about our teams
Our project experience includes diverse industries such as aerospace, military, finance, marketing...
We have all been a part of projects that have succeeded...and failed.
We have learnt from all, especially the failures.
We have experienced projects where good QA practice has been largely ignored and we have experienced projects where QA has been front and centre.
We have built, and led, teams of QA professionals, both onshore and off
What makes us different is that we practice what we teach on a daily basis.
We don't believe that one size fits all
We don't do theory, we do practical
We don't do hypothetical, we do pragmatic
We don't do unicorn testing, we do reality
We don't do wishful thinking, we do actuality
